# modal project 

It is a simple project which main focus is about event deligation and global events.
Event deligation is applied on all three button where I attached a eventListener to the common parent of the buttons and then used .closest() to achieve the desire result.
The global event happens when user click on Esc button from keyboard and the modal closes.
ThankYou!!ðŸ˜Š
